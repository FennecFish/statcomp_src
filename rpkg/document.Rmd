# Types of documentation in R

There are two main locations in an R package which contain
documentation:

1) help pages (sometimes called "man pages") for each function
2) vignettes (longer form with R code chunks embedded in text)

We will show in this lecture note how to generate documentation for
both. For the function help pages, I strongly recommend to use
*roxygen* formatting and the `document` function from the *devtools*
package, which will be covered here. This will automatically generate
both the `.Rd` files that go in the `man` directory, and it will
populate the `NAMESPACE` file which specifies what is exported and
what is imported by your package.
