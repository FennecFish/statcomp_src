# Introduction

Reading:  GH Chapter 4, McCullough Chapter 1

EM for missing data problems, but general problems can be formulated in this framework to facilitate estimation.  General purpose optimization, regarded as "workhorse" computing algorithms in statistics along with MCMC.  We will see that several of the concepts introduced in the last lecture are embedded in this approach, and in turn the modularity of the EM algorithm also facilitates relatively simple extensions to situations such variable selection via penalized likelihood and random effect models.  The relative ease of implementation is one of the benefits of its use, in addition to several of the applications
