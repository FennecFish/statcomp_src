# Maximization of poisson GLMM from lecture

Lets now maximize the poisson GLMM model given in lecture, now using an MCEM approach.  In the E-step, please use a Metropolis Hastings Random Walk proposal distribution to appoximate the Q-function.   Specify your proposal distribution.  Write functions implementing the E-step, the M-step, and then write the main code for the MCEM algorithm.  

```{r}
## Solution: place relevant helper functions pertaining to the E step here 

## End Solution


## Solution: place relevant helper functions pertaining to the M step here 

## End Solution


## Solution: place primary code for the MCEM algorithm here, calling functions in the above two sections
## Remember to print your primary results and use the following starting values

## End Solution


```
